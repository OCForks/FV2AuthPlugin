# FV2AuthPlugin

Here is an Authorization Plugin that is designed to automatically, seamlessly and silently add users to FileVault 2 while the user is authenticating at the Login Window.

**Update for 10.11 El Capitan and Xcode 7**

## How to install

The plugin must live here: `/Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/FV2AuthPlugin.bundle`

FV2AuthPlugin is called from the system.login.console in the authorization databse.

## Package Installer

You can grab the installer here. This binary does have code signing. The installer is signed. An uninstaller is included.
https://github.com/tburgin/FV2AuthPlugin/releases


## Manual Install

1.  Build the FV2AuthPlugin.bundle with xcode from the source or download the latest binary from: https://github.com/tburgin/FV2AuthPlugin/releases. If you build your own, make sure to sign the bundle. The login window will reset every login if the bundle is not signed.

2. Copy the plugin to the SecurityAgentPlugins folder
```sh
sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/FV2AuthPlugin.bundle /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/;
```

3. Set Proper Ownership
```sh
sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/FV2AuthPlugin.bundle;
```

4. Set Proper Permissions
```sh
sudo chmod -R 755 /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/FV2AuthPlugin.bundle;
```

## How does it work?

Authorization Plugins give us access to a gold mine of information during the login process. We are able to capture the login user's username and clear text password. The FV2AuthPlugin runs after the builtin:authenticate,privileged runs, so we know that password used is valid.

~~Now that we have the user's credenials, all we need is an admin account to authorize FV2 addition. Since we run the FV2AuthPlugin in privileged mode we have the ability to create a temporary local admin user and set it's password. This admin account is destroyed right after the login user is added to FV2. This temporary admin account has no UID / GID and has no SHELL assigned.~~

Thanks to @russellhancox for alerting me to the fact that an admin account is not required. The authenticating user's credentials are sufficient.

```objective-c
BOOL ret = ODFDEAddUser(username, password, username, password);
```

The `/usr/lib/libodfde.dylib` has an undocumented symbol `ODFDEAddUser`. Thanks again to @russellhancox for publishing the correct variables needed in the macdestoryer repo:

  *  https://github.com/google/macops/tree/master/macdestroyer

```objective-c
extern BOOL ODFDEAddUser(CFStringRef username, CFStringRef password, CFStringRef username, CFStringRef password);
```

We now have everything we need to add a user to FileVault2. Keep in mind that ODFDEAddUser is undocumented and will most likely be changed in future release of OS X.

This symbol still exists in 10.10.4 and works for our purposes.
